# Portfolio
This Portfolio is a compilation of most relevant Data Science and Data Analysis projects I did for academic, self-learning and hobby purposes. 

## Projects

It is common to assume normality in errors of a regression model, but in the presence of outliers it can't be robust enough.
In this project I have used studentÂ´s-t as error and bayesian inference to get the posterior distribution of the parameters. A Monte Carlo simulation was conduced to compare the normal and student's-t errors in the presence of outliers. The conclusion was that the parameters assuming student's-t errors can be less biased than assuming normal errors.

This is our solution for the brewing-datacup 2020(rank 8/41). The main problem was to create a model to estimate the probability that a customer will take a promotion. To generate the solution techniques as feature engineering(features aggregation) and group cross validation improved the score. A package in python was built to generate the solution.
